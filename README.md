A Java console application made in Intellij. 

# The application contains
- Various character classes having attributes which increase at different rates as the character gains levels.
- Equipment, such as armor and weapons, that characters can equip. The equipped items will alter the power of the character, causing it to deal more damage and be able to survive longer. Certain characters can equip certain item types.
- Custom exceptions. There are two custom exceptions, one handling the wrong use of weapons and the other wrong use of armor.
- Full test coverage of the functionality.
